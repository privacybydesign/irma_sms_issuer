/**
 * Store rate limits in memory. Useful for debugging and rate limits that
 * aren't very long.
 *
 * How it works:
 * How much budget a user has, is expressed in a timestamp. The timestamp is
 * initially some period in the past, but with every usage (countIP and
 * countPhone) this timestamp is incremented. For IP address counting, this
 * is a fixed amount (currently 10 seconds), but for phone numbers this
 * amount is exponential.
 *
 * An algorithm with a similar goal is the Token Bucket algorithm. This
 * algorithm probably works well, but seemed harder to implement.
